Take your time why don't you! It's **only your first day** and all :p. OK seriously here's the deal: *we have 10 days before all hell breaks loose*. I need to get you up and running as quickly as I can.

I'm sure you've [installed Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) already. If you haven't do that now - I don't have to hold your hand through that do I?

Once that's done, check to be sure you have it setup right:

```sh
iex
```

You should see something that looks like this:

```
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Interactive Elixir (1.1.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

Don't worry if you don't know what it means. If this doesn't work for you [read up on the docs](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
